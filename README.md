# Dissertation Landing Page

## Leslie Huang

## NYU Center for Data Science

This page provides an overview of where to find the code that generated the results presented in each chapter of the dissertation.

For each project, I separately enumerate _modules_ that can be installed via `pip` (Python) or `CRAN` (R) and _analysis code_ that fit models, visualizes data, etc. and generates the results in the paper (and requires the corresponding modules to run).

See the bottom of the page for an index that lists the script/Jupyter Notebook which generated each figure, table, or estimate appearing in the dissertation.
